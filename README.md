# JWallet
A way to generate paper wallets in your CLI

**WARNING** *JWallet is a hobby project and may be unstable at times. Use at your own risk.*

JWallet is a CLI tool dedicated to securely generating paper wallets 
for popular cryptocurrencies. A *paper wallet* is all the information 
needed for a wallet stored somewhere non-electronic, be it a literal piece of paper
or stamped on a piece of metal. Paper wallets aren't perfect as they can
be easy to lose, but they do add a layer of security to one's crypto wallet.

These wallets are generated and then deleted upon exit. It is up to 
the user to note their private keys and addresses before they choose
to close the program. Text is not stored in terminal/bash history, and unless 
one's system has a keylogger, a private key can be typed in to generate
the public address.

## My Thoughts

I never liked the idea of my wallet being kept track of by some central server
connected to a personal account. Isn't the point of crypto to be decentralized? 
And to be used as a currency? Not an investment? 

I have my own opinions about the state of crypto, and they play a role
as to way I don't interract much with it.

I'm not much of a crypto investor, but I've always had 
an interest in the technology behind it all. With that interest,
I've learned a lot about the concepts of blockchain, but I haven't
applied much of my knowledge to anything. I plan on doing a lot 
more crypto-related development, even though I'm not a fan
of certain aspects of the current crypto world.
