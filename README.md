# JWallet
A way to generate paper wallets in your CLI

Although I haven't been into crypto investing much, I've always had
an interest in the technology behind it. One of my first projects
on GitHub was a local blockchain made in Python. I didn't do anything
with it, but that's where this comes in. 

JWallet is a CLI tool dedicated to securely generating paper wallets 
for popular cryptocurrencies. A *paper wallet* is all the information 
needed for a wallet stored somewhere non-electronic, be it a literal piece of paper
or stamped on a piece of metal. Paper wallets aren't perfect as they can
be easy to lose, but they do add a layer of security to one's crypto wallet.
I never liked the idea of my wallet being kept track of by some central server.
Isn't the point of crypto to be decentralized? I don't know. I just code.
